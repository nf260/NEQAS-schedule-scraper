# NEQAS-schedule-scraper
Birmingham Quality is the main provider of Clinical Biochemistry external quality assessment (EQA) services in the UK.

Distribution schedules for Birmingham Quality external quality assessment samples have historically been provided as PDF files only.

The NEQAS-schedule-scraper downloads PDF files from the [Birmingham Quality website](https://birminghamquality.org.uk/schedules/), scrapes the distribution dispatch and return dates, and exports these as a csv file

## Update 21st December 2020
The NEQAS-schedule-scraper was [reported on the Association for Clinical Biochemistry Mailbase on 19th December 2020](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind2012&L=ACB-CLIN-CHEM-GEN&O=D&P=46519)

Shortly afterwards on 21st December 2020, [Birmingham Quality announced](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind2012&L=ACB-CLIN-CHEM-GEN&O=D&P=52983) that they would be providing schedules in .csv format.
